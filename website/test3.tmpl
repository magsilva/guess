<P>You may need to refresh to get the applet to pop up (and make sure you have pop up blockers disabled).<BR> Tested on Java plug-in version 1.4+</B><BR><BR>You can try to work through the <A HREF="manual.html#_Toc116465163" TARGET=_tutorial>tutorial</A> to get a sense of the language.</P>

This graph has ~400 nodes and ~700 edges.  Each node has a property "dept" (department) property associated with it and each edge has a "freq" property (frequency of communication).<P>Some commands to try:</P>
<UL>
<LI><i>center(v5)</i> zoom in to node v5
<LI><i>center(v401-v177)</I> center on the edge between v401 and v177
<LI><I>center() </i> center on everything
<LI><I>gemLayout() </i> gem layout 
<LI><I>binPackLayout() </i> packing layout
<LI><I>(dept == 'dept1').color = red </i> color every node in dept1 red
<LI><I>colorize(dept)</i> color every department a different color
<LI><I>colorize(freq,red,blue)</i> color each edge by frequency of communication from red to blue
<LI><I>g.nodes.style = 4 </i> change the node style for all nodes
<LI><I>((dept == 'dept20')-(dept == 'dept1')).color = black</i> Make edges between department 1 and 20 black.
